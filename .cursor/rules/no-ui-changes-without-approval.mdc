# No UI Changes Without Approval

- Do not make any UI or UI-behavior changes without explicit user approval.
- This includes visual changes, layout changes, interactions, and behavioral tweaks.
- If a UI change is needed, ask for explicit approval before editing.
- You may edit any relevant files once explicit approval is given.

## Examples

// ❌ BAD (no approval)
Change button behavior or layout without a user "go".

// ✅ GOOD (with approval)
"I can change the upload button behavior. Say 'go' to proceed."
