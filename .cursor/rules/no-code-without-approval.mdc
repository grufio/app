description: Never change code/SQL without explicit user approval
alwaysApply: true

# No code changes without approval

## Rule

- Do **not** modify any files (code, SQL, configs, docs) unless the user explicitly approves the specific change.
- If changes are needed, present a **clear plan + diff summary** first, then wait for a "Go"/approval.
- Allowed without approval: **read-only** actions (searching, reading files, explaining, proposing approaches).

## When approval is required

- Any edit via patches
- Creating/deleting files
- Running commands that change repo state (including git write operations)
- Formatting/refactors, even if “safe”

## Approval format

User must explicitly confirm, e.g.:
- “Go”
- “Mach das”
- “Apply the changes”
