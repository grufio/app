# No guessing, trial/error, or assumptions

## Rule

- Do **not** solve bugs or behavior issues by guessing.
- Do **not** rely on trial/error as the primary approach.
- Do **not** proceed based on unstated assumptions.
- Base every fix on observable evidence (logs, query output, failing tests, reproducible steps, or code-path verification).

## Required working mode

- First isolate the failure point using concrete evidence.
- State the verified cause in precise terms before changing code.
- Apply the smallest deterministic change that addresses the verified cause.
- Verify with targeted tests/checks and report the result.

## Forbidden patterns

- "Probably/maybe" fixes without proof.
- Multiple speculative changes in one step.
- Declaring success without a concrete verification result.
