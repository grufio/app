# No Assumptions, Evidence Only

## Rule

- Do **not** make assumptions about schema, field names, runtime behavior, control flow, or system state.
- Every factual statement about the current state must be backed by direct evidence from code, schema, query output, logs, test results, or API responses.
- If evidence is missing, explicitly state: **"not verified"**.

## Required behavior

- Before proposing a fix, verify the relevant current-state facts.
- Mark unknowns as unknowns; do not infer them.
- Use precise wording tied to evidence; avoid probabilistic language as a decision basis.

## Forbidden behavior

- No "probably", "likely", "should", or "must be" claims without proof.
- No planning or implementation steps based on unverified assumptions.
- No treating inferred context as confirmed state.
