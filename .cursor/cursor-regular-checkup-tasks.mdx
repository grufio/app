# Cursor Regular Checkup & Optimization Tasks

This document defines **recurring Cursor tasks** to keep the codebase clean, performant,
and free of accumulating technical debt in an AI-assisted workflow.

Use this list **weekly** or **per milestone**.

---

## 🔁 Weekly Checkup (Mandatory)

### 1. Architecture & Structure
- [ ] Identify files exceeding a reasonable size or responsibility
- [ ] Split combined concerns (data loading, UI state, rendering)
- [ ] Verify Server vs Client Component boundaries
- [ ] Remove unused abstractions or layers

### 2. State & Persistence
- [ ] Verify persistence strategy (debounce, commit-on-end)
- [ ] Check for unnecessary or chatty writes
- [ ] Ensure no race conditions between UI and backend
- [ ] Confirm ownership of state is explicit

### 3. Rendering & Performance
- [ ] Identify unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Ensure hooks and callbacks are stable where required
- [ ] Verify RAF throttling / event throttling consistency
- [ ] Remove premature memoization

---

## ⚠️ P1 Optimization Tasks (High Priority)

### Editor / Canvas
- [ ] Profile selection, bounds calculation, and transforms
- [ ] Ensure deterministic output for identical input
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary bounds recalculation
- [ ] Verify zoom/pan behavior remains stable across updates

### UI Consistency
- [ ] Verify UI language consistency (no mixed DE/EN)
- [ ] Check dialogs, labels, and errors for consistency
- [ ] Remove leftover skeletons or temporary UI states

---

## 🧼 P2 Hygiene Tasks (Medium Priority)

### Code Hygiene
- [ ] Remove dead code and obsolete TODOs
- [ ] Verify comments still reflect actual behavior
- [ ] Ensure predictable component output
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary memoization or callbacks

### Dependencies
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Re-evaluate recently added libraries
- [ ] Ensure no accidental coupling between modules

---

## 🧪 Testing & Coverage

- [ ] Verify coverage for formatting, snapping, and model math
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases (grid presets, unit changes, float precision)
- [ ] Ensure tests validate behavior, not implementation

---

## 📚 Documentation & Specs

- [ ] Update README if behavior changed
- [ ] Align specs with actual editor model (artboard, DPI, units)
- [ ] Document persistence and storage decisions
- [ ] Keep CLI / workflow docs in sync

---

## ✂️ Reduction Pass (Mandatory)

Explicitly ask:
- [ ] What can be deleted?
- [ ] What can be simplified?
- [ ] What abstraction is no longer justified?

If nothing can be removed, **re-evaluate the design**.

---

## 🚦 Final Gate

Before closing the iteration:
- [ ] Complexity reduced or stable
- [ ] No new tech debt accepted silently
- [ ] Codebase easier to reason about than before

---

## Rule
> Optimization is not about speed.
> Optimization is about keeping the system understandable.
